# Perfect-Calculator-Tkinter
This is a perfect calculator because it can calculate any type of difficult 
mathematical expressions without any error. The only thing you have to do is 
that just enter valid mathematical expression. I don't think there will be any 
restrictions where you cannot input more characters because I didn't set up any.
There is one issue that if you input negative number with negative sign, 
it will not calculate and will show you an error. I will try to fix that 
problem and upload new version as soon as possible. Also when you calculate any 
complex mathematical expression, make sure that you have used brackects 
properly. Because it can't calculate expression if you didn't close the brackets.
If you have any suggestion or contribution, feel free to do it.
